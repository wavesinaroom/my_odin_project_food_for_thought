# Project background

This is my django/python first project. So far, I've been focused on Javascript and its frameworks to learn both frontend and backend development so I want to steer away from them now to venture into new technologies and a new programming language. 

I thought that I should've chosen Python to start my journey in programming. But then I realised that in spite of not liking Javascript completely I should be more grateful with all the foundations I learned from it. Today is today and I'm glad to have development skills in Javascript that I'm sure will be an advantage during my job hunting process. 

Python was my chosen language to continue on my training in web development because it is widely used in cybersecurity which is another field of my interest. Currently, I'm workin on skills in that area as well to be included in my portfolio. Hopefully, I can find a job position in the future that offers me a chance to combine cybersecurity and backend development.
